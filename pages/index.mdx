## Objective

We aim to make these web3 funding coalitions legibile so that its easier to join a coalition that funds your infrasturture.

The goal of this repo is to be a "switzerland" of coalitional funding.  We are neutral and do not favor any one coalition or agenda over another.  If you want to PR some changes in, you [can do so here](https://github.com/owocki/coalitions.wtf/).
